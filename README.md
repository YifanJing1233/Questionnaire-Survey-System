# Questionnaire System with HTML and Spring Boot

This document outlines the use of HTML for frontend presentation and Spring Boot for backend development in building a robust questionnaire system.

## Separation of Frontend and Backend

- **Frontend (HTML):** Manages the display layer, allowing users to interact with the questionnaire, fill out answers, and submit responses.
- **Backend (Spring Boot):** Handles logic for data validation, processing business rules, and database interactions. This separation enhances development clarity and maintenance efficiency.

## User Experience

- **Interactive Interfaces:** Leveraging CSS and JavaScript along with HTML, the system offers dynamic and interactive user interfaces, critical for engaging users and improving response rates.

## Scalability and Maintainability

- **Framework Features:** Spring Boot provides auto-configuration, embedded server options, and health checks, making the application scalable and easy to maintain.

## Security

- **Robust Security:** Features like OAuth2 and Spring Security are integral to Spring Boot, ensuring that the application remains secureâ€”essential for protecting user data in a questionnaire system.

## Data Interaction

- **Efficient API Communication:** The system uses RESTful APIs or Spring MVC for effective communication between the frontend and backend, facilitating smooth data transactions.

## Database Support

- **Flexible Database Integration:** Spring Boot supports multiple databases, this project is using MySQL based on project requirements.

## Run Project locally
- To execute the JAR file, type `java -jar questionquestionnaire-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar` in your terminal.
